# ProfJam's RLCraft+ Modpack Updater
This is a simple script that makes the needed changes for Professor Jam's RLCraft server.

# Usage
1. Download the [latest UpdateModpack.ps1](https://github.com/DechertNicholas/ProfJamRLCraftPlus/releases/latest) by clicking on it and choosing "save".

    ![Choose save](https://github.com/DechertNicholas/ProfJamRLCraftPlus/blob/a005915890e042a264a69b5c4b7f21e2f3a89887/readmeImages/Download.gif)

2. Copy the downloaded script to your RLCraft directory. If you play RLCraft on other servers, you should make a copy of this directory first as it will overwrite some files that won't be used on pure RLCraft servers
   

3. Right-click on the script and choose "Run with Powershell". If Windows asks if you want to open it, select "Open". If it ask if you want to change the execution policy, choose "Y". The script will then run and make the needed changes
